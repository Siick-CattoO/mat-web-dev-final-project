          <p>
            Let us take a look at some of my favorite hobbies of this world: I
            will start with animals at this point, cuz they just make my heart
            jump of happines. Of course there are pros and cons, so let me
            introduce it to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine the life without domestic animals: No fluffy cuddling, no
            wet nose boopers and no fuzzy, loose hait in your mouth, while
            eating. To be honest: Yes they need your care, a full amount of time
            and a small to lager budget of your hard earned money. But on the
            other hand, you would never experience the uncondicionally, honest
            love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find the animal maching to your personality and your idea of time
            management. If you don't want to take this responsibility on your
            sholders, you better not think about a dog, or a cat for example.
            You can go with terraristic for less time consuming hobby, but also
            think about the specific thermal conditions. At the end you have the
            difficult choice to make, how much you want to invest, how long do
            you want to spent time for your furry friend and very important to
            know is your status of allergic reaction if you are interessted in
            having a coated friend by your side. At first you always should
            search for a pet in animal shelters, because every creature is worth
            to get a second, third, or more chances to find the perfect forever
            home. Now you can ask yourself: 
          </p>
          <p>ARE YOU READY TO CARE ABOUT A PET?</p>

            That is probably the most mentioned sentence ever. But at the same
            point, it is true. Everyone has a different view about construction,
            meaning, and design to transport the inner statement to the world.
            The way we feel, live and learn is as fascinating as the thinking of
            each one of us. There is no fault and also no right in the way you
            express your art.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can draw pictures by hand with pencils, brushes, with your bare
            fingers or even with the whole body. Show your feelings and
            interests how you want them to appear. Use the items you feel
            confident with, explore your colorful vane and If you are worriing
            about the beginnings: dont worry! You will get better with
            practicing more and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The art community is extremly huge. Art exists since the beginning
            of the evolution of human beeing. So do the own point of view. You
            will find forums, websites, exhibitions and many more containing
            art, such as in everyday life. For example street art makes cities
            colorful and stereotypical urban at the same time. Keep your eyes
            open, and you will find art in every corner of this world. 
          </p>
          <p>CAN YOU
            SEE THE ART OR IS IT WASTE?</p>

            This hobby is for little workohollics like I am. Nothing will me as
            time intense as Web Design, Media Design and computer stuff. On your
            exciting path to learn the myssticle language of coding websites,
            you will quickly question yourself several things and slightly
            forget about the real world.Do you have the endurance? Can you be
            persistent enough? The answer is: YES YOU CAN!
          </p>
          <p>
            Take a step back, breathe in and breathe out: It will get better
            soon, too. Same thing as as art-practice, you have to repeat
            constantly. Learn to combine your advanced knowllege. Have no fear
            to make mistakes, you can solve them by investigate. Nothing will be
            harder to continue, when you feeling down like a server, but on the
            other hand you will be able to change your thinking about yourself,
            if you come to the final project and code your lines with
            understanding the context. Represent your content and your design
            like in a more technical kind of art.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't make yourself crazy about this. Every language is a unique
            one. And no one said that it would be easy to learn it. Just try to
            imagine all the fabulous journeys you can conduct a user through
            your hardly (or maybe easly for some of you) designt and developed
            website like mine, just to give you an imagination of what you can
            create by just typing some words in clamps. Developing is no
            witchcraft, if you think so now. Or is it?

            Balnace it the clue to this kind of hobby. To take the fear of you:
            A homan can learn almost everything by practicing, so you will read
            this a little more often on this page. If you love to get adrenaline
            rushing through your blood, this sport is one of the posible maching
            ones for you. Pushing the board with your feet, training your whole
            body every time you cruise through the streets, makes you healthier.
            Not only your brain will get more oxygen: Your musckes will getting
            stronger and your mindset will change, because moving at the outside
            with fresh air in your longues has always positive effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I give you a hint: Nobody is perfect, aspecialy not at the
            beginning. At first you should care about your safty. A longboard or
            skateboard is just a piece of wood with two achses and only four
            wheels which seperate your feet from the street. Buy yourself a pair
            of gloves, arm & leg guard, and for shure a good rated helmet. A
            board can be extremly shaky for the first tries, so prevent your
            body from the consequences od falling down. Extremly hard practice
            can push your body to its limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            So take it calm and start with shorter sessions, skate with friends
            or try some new tricks, if you want it a little more challenging.
            Never give up when you fall. Get on the board again, as soon as
            possible, even if your knee is hurting a bit, you will survive it
            and the next time you reach your goal, you will be proud of yourself
            and gain confidence more and more. Your body will know, when it's
            enough for the day, so don't push yourself over your limits. That
            can be dangerous, not only for you. If you lose control over your
            balance or board, situations can change very quickly. 
          </p>
          <p>WILL YOU SPEED
            UP TO ANOTHER LEVEL OF BOARDING?</p>

            Music is like an elixier of life. The bass moving the air in your
            longues. The beat automatically stomping your feet. The rhythm flows
            to the body and hardly trying to not move. Music is so much more,
            than listening. It's a pleasure and joy of all body parts. As you
            can read, my soul is burning for the happines the music brings to
            me.

            appearing a lot of mixed genres combined to a new one everyday. Big
            Band music with a full orchestra ensamble, jazzy or funky songs with
            twists and "questioning & answer"-games between different
            instrumental groups. Pop-artists are mostly performing als single
            artist, writing songs, finding melodies and producing with an amount
            of people around them to release their new hot stuff to the charts,
            so their music can be played in clubs and bars for the young and
            fresh party generation. Rock Bands are a bit harder, expressing
            feelings and meanings in different kinds of speed , such as metal
            bands which the most people would call "shouting of anger". The
            music-community is spreaded all over the planet and colorful like a
            rainbow.

            At least you can try to find your passion in playing an instrument
            for yourself. My heart is beating for the drum kit, playing and
            training it the half of my life. Hit the skin-pads and crashing the
            cymbals is super goot to train the raction, multitasking and
            technical rhythm techniques. Or would you rather play the guitar or
            bass-guitar to change the spectrum of sounds you can create?

            Playing video games is a philosophy for its own: A lot of people
            love it, the others hate it. Since the last years the gaming scene
            is expanding exponential. In the past, when the jurney of gaming onb
            technical devices started, the most parents thought this is only a
            hobby for children or youngsters, but the evolution of video games
            rushes in such speed, nobody can say exactly when this changed.
            Nowadays the most players are adults and a very very big amount of
            games are constructed for the older generation. FSK 18 games are
            showing brutal content or spladdering fluids of the inner body.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you you start to play a game you like you can easly forget the
            time and float to another world or galaxy. There are all kinds of
            games, so everybody canfind the right one. Ego-shooter where you run
            in first person and (like the name sais it already) shoot other
            players in the digital world, to collect experience-points for
            upleveling or special ingame-items. Role-Play-Games where you can
            change everything you have not in your real life, and build a whole
            new community with friends or strangers in mustiplayer-mode.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it is also dangerous, because too much gaming can have an
            addictive effect on some people. You have to remeber: The real life
            still exists and you still have to care about it. Don't flee to the
            other world for too long, because nobody will come to you and tell
            you have to do this or that now like a parent forever. Bills have to
            be paid and food is also important.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter what your favorite games will be, or if you prefer to play
            on the computer or console, the colorful moving interactive stories
            you will see, can also be productive and educating. 
          </p>
          <p>MAYBE YOU WILL
            BECOME THE NEXT LEVER PLAYER OF TOMORROW?</p>

            Who doeasn't like to travel? Ok, I think there are some peoples that
            really don't like traveling a lot. But on the other hand you don't
            need to feel guilty, if you want to see the world for your own,
            touch the sand with your own bare feet and breathe the soft moosed
            air of a forrest you always wanted to travel to. You can make a
            roadtrip by car, bicycle or foot, take your time to relax and
            refresh your powers for the life we are lifing nowadays.
          </p>

          <p>
            Relaxing is not the only way you can explore new places and make new
            unknown experiences. Go out, see the beauty of this planet and smell
            all of the scents you would never have known without leaving the
            wellknown hometown. Try to communicate with other people and learn
            about their cultures, respect the different places where other
            people live and their happiness in beeing there.
          </p>
          <p>
            But maybe you are the kind of person that always wanted to make a
            basejump out of an airplane, or prove yourself how brave you are and
            dive with the sharks in the ocean. Of course you have to save some
            money to have the possibility to buy some food or have a nice
            sleepover room at a hotel, but it's your choice now where you want
            to go:

            The Last Point of my favorite hobbies I can recommend is the
            peaceful photography. This one is a splitting point, because some
            people are swearing to their realy expensive equipment and they
            think that's the needing thing to shoot good pictures. The truth is
            (just to repat myself: in my opinion) you don't need to buy a 5K
            camera and you will automatically make great pictures without
            learning the basics. Like I said before: The most important thing is
            practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Photography is not the cheapest hobby. Give me a moment to remember:
            no one is perfect and no master has ever fallen from the sky.
            Whatever you want to catsch up in ohne tiny moment of life: the
            motive you have chosen will be well prepared. Train your eye to see
            small things, maybe start with details the most people are ignoring,
            than everyone will say
            <q
              >"Wow, I never thought about this way to see this thing like
              you."</q
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            To catch the right pic at the right time you have to stay calm. If
            your passion will be the macro photography, where you can catch the
            smallest details of a plant or choose other motives, you will have
            to spend a bit of cash, to get good basic devices equiped for usable
            photographes. If you are interessted in action photography, you will
            need a good hight resolution video cam and the right reflexes. With
            enough time and patience you will get wonderful pictures for your
            photo album.SO DO YOU WANT TO CATCH THE BEATY IN A PICTURE?
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope I could've helped you choose the right spare time activity
            for you and your personal habits.
